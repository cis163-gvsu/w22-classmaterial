# Queues

---

### Queue ADT

* Collection of elements
* First in - first out (FIFO)
* Primary operations:
    * enqueue (add to end)
    * dequeue (remove from front)
* Like stacks, linear/sequential - aka, have an ordering

---

### Real life examples:

* Lines anywhere:
    * store
    * amusement park
    * sports arenas

---

### When to use?

* Like stacks
* Depends on the problem
* Not useful for all problems
* Really useful for some problems, algorithms
* Again, think about problem/algorithm first

---

### Coding Applications

* Extremely useful for implementing graph/tree problems (BFS)
    * Shortest path
    * Island finding
* OS scheduling
* Network connections, routing
