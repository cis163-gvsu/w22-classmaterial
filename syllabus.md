## Special Needs
If there is any student in this class who has special needs because of a disability, please contact https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ (DSS) at 616-331-2490 and also reach out to me.

## Academic Honesty
All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information Systems, the details of which can be found at https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/academic-honesty/

Academic integrity is taken very seriously and typically result in anywhere from a 0 on the assessment along with a reduction in the overall course grade to failure in the course.  All instances of academic integrity will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR).  Unless otherwise indicated, the work you turn in must be your own.  If you have questions about what is permitted, you are responsible for reaching out to me before you turn something in.

#### FAQs:

* Can I seek help through sites like upwork? *No, this would generally be
  considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I have help from a tutor?  *You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
  you submit for projects/labs in the end must be your own.*
* Can I use sites like stackoverflow?  *Yes, this is allowed in this course,
  so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
  for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
  portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).*
* Can I use sites like Chegg?  *No, this would be considered an academic
  integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question*

#### Regret Policy
I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after.  In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy".  Within 48 hours of
the due date (or late deadline if working on it late)
for a project or within 48 hours of completing an exam, you can
withdraw your submission if after contemplation you believe you may have committed
academic misconduct.  To do so, you must inform me in via email or private Piazza
note within 48 hours of the due date / late deadline including the following text:

> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause
1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened.  Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
  invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date / late
deadline / exam completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

## Grading

* Last day to drop a course with a grade of "W" is Friday, March 11, 2022 by 5:00pm
* IMPORTANT: The instructor reserves the right to invoke the following: In order to pass this course with a grade of C or better, you must have an average of at least 60% in exams (tests, final exam, and Lab exam). 
* Your grade in the course will be determined based on all the work assigned (see table below) in the course using the grading scale shown below.

| Item  | Percent of Overall Grade   |
| ----- | ----- |
| Programming Project 1	| 13% |
| Programming Project 2 | 13% |
| Programming Project 3 | 13% |
| Tests	| 30% |
| Final Exam | 20% |
| Labs | 8% |
| Participation/Class Attendance | 3% |


## Grading Scale:
The instructor reserves the right to shift the scale downward at the end of the semester,
in the student’s favor, to find natural break points within the classes scores.
This shift downward typically occurs at the end of the semester.  For example: 92.5
could be an A, not just 94% and higher for an A.  The scale will never shift upward.
For example: 88% is always at least a B+.)

|     |    |    |    |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A	 | 94% | C  | 73% |
| A- | 90% | C-	| 70% |
| B+ | 88% | D+	| 67% |
| B	 | 84% | D	| 60% |
| B- | 80% | F	| below 60% |
| C+ | 77% |    |   |

## Programming Projects
Programming projects require considerable amount of time outside of class. I advise you to budget your time properly. You are encouraged to discuss the assignment specifications with your instructor (and with your fellow students). However, anything that you submit for grading must be your own work. 

### Submission & Late Policy.
* Late penalty is 20% first day, non-first day 10% per day (unless stated in the assignment). Weekend counts as one weekday. Projects will not be accepted after one week late.
* You will be required to demo your project to the instructor.  

## Course Policies
* All homework and programming projects, unless otherwise specified by the instructor,
  are to be completed individually. Students are encouraged to consult each other for instructional assistance only.
* The instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course calendar, and assignment point values and due dates.


### PrairieLearn Policies
PrairieLearn (PL) will be used for coding projects, labs, and tests.
PL is an online system that will allow you to submit code for
autograding.  You will be able to submit, see your grade, and resubmit
prior to the due date/time to improve your grade without penalty as
many times as you wish.  Except in cases of academic integrity violations or
attempts to fool the autograder,
in which case your score may be lowered after the fact,
your score for autograded problems will be the score on PrairieLearn (unless you
submit after the deadline and late days are up, in which case your score for the project will not change).
If you submit code that does not run or compile,
you will receive a 0.  Any partial credit for the autograded portion will be awarded by the autograder; no
additional partial credit will be awarded.  For projects, there
may be a manually graded portion as well -- these points will be
awarded manually.  

The goal of using PL is to, as a whole, improve grades by
allowing you to assess your solution and continue to refine it.
For coding problems, there are often both visible test cases and hidden
test cases.  For many problems, the hidden test cases are edge cases
that may not be something that was considered when you first developed
your approach to the problem.  The goal of the autograder is to

1. Let you see when your solution is correct
2. Help you become a better programmer by forcing you to think
   carefully about what scenarios may arise.

If you believe there is an issue
with the autograder, please post a private note on Piazza ASAP.

### Test Policies
Tests will be taken on PrairieLearn during lab and consist of both
non-coding (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.) questions
and one or more coding questions.  

## Face Masks
Face coverings that cover both the nose and mouth are required to be worn
in the classroom. Students who have forgotten their face covering
may get a disposable mask at a campus office. The evidence is clear that face
coverings are a crucial part of keeping coronavirus at bay.
Students refusing to wear a mask correctly
will be asked to leave the classroom and a student conduct report may be filed.

## Equity and Inclusion
As an instructor, I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning
environment in our class.  Please reach out to me if there is any behavior in
the classroom that makes you feel unwelcome in any way.  To the extent permitted
by law, I will keep this information confidential.
