# Searching

If we have a group of objects (like an ArrayList or
array), one common task is to find a designated target
or determine that it doesn't exist.

This process is called "searching". 

## Task 1

Think about the idea of searching and how we can 
implement it -- the most obvous solution (and probably the
one that comes to mind is to just walk down an array, from start to end, looking
for the desired element.  This is known as "linear search".
It does not care about the order
of the elements in the array.

If the input array was sorted, is there a way
we could implement this that would be more efficient?
Describe it in words below.

## Task 2

Try stepping through your process on the following array and
searching for the element `50`:

```
[10 18 20 21 25 29 30 40 50 80 81]


















```


## Task 3

Implement the below function to code the process you
described and demonstrated in tasks 1 and 2.  You
can feel free to add any helper functions you would
like.

```
public static int search(int[] data, int element) {






}
















```
