# Lab 1

Since this lab is mostly setup, none of it will be submitted to PrairieLearn.

There are two parts to this lab:
1. [Setting up VSCode](vscode-setup.md)
2. [Testing Activity](https://www.code-defenders.org)
   Find the battleground that says profC (was 6930), join
   one of the 2 teams (defending is probably the best practice)
   and play around for 5-10 minutes.
