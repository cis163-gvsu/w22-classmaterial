# Welcome to CIS 163:  Computer Science II

### Course Overview
This course should help you go from being able to program to writing good code that is correct.
This can mean a lot of things:
* clear, clean, and concise
* algorithmically elegant
* well-tested, handles edge cases, well thought
* efficient (from an algorithmic complexity way)
* appropriate selection of data structures.

Unlike 162 where the goal is just to write code to solve a problem, the goal here is to really think about
what you are coding, how you are solving the problem, what it means to be correct, etc.
This requires a deeper understanding
of what is happening and the code and a more intentional approach.

### Need Help?
If you have questions, please ask!  I'm here to help.  I welcome students
to drop by office hours, either virtual or in-person,
to work on their projects and listen to questions others might have (or chat
about other CS topics, grad school, etc.)

### COVID
While the goal for this semester is to be as normal as possilbe,
with COVID there will still likely be
surprises and we will need to be flexible to accommodate changes.

I recognize the difficulties some of you may face.
My goal is to make this semester as effective and as smooth
as possible.  Please reach out to me early and keep me informed
of any issues that arise.
